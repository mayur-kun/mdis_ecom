This repository showcases my master's research project focusing on customer churn prediction. Leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I developed a comprehensive solution to identify customers at risk of attrition and empower businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.

Key Highlights:
1. Data Analysis: Utilized BigQuery to analyze large-scale customer data, uncovering patterns and trends influencing churn behavior.
2. Model Development: Built a high-accuracy Random Forest model on Vertex AI to predict customer churn probability.
3. Scalable Deployment: Deployed the model as a Streamlit app for user-friendly insights and predictions, enabling easy integration with existing workflows.
4. GCP Advantages: Demonstrated the benefits of GCP for machine learning projects, including scalability, security, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

This project contributes to:
1. Improved customer retention through accurate churn prediction and targeted engagement.
2. Data-driven decision making for businesses based on actionable insights.
3. Showcasing the capabilities of GCP for real-world machine learning applications.
